=head1 NAME

Graph::Writer::XML - write out directed graph as XML

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Graph;
    use Graph::Writer::XML;
    
    $graph = Graph->new();
    # add edges and nodes to the graph
    
    $writer = Graph::Writer::XML->new();
    $writer->write_graph($graph, 'mygraph.xml');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Graph::Writer::XML> is a class for writing out a directed graph
in a simple XML format.
The graph must be an instance of the Graph class, which is
actually a set of classes developed by Jarkko Hietaniemi.

The XML format is designed to support the Graph classes:
it can be used to represent a single graph with a collection
of nodes, and edges between those nodes.
The graph, nodes, and edges can all have attributes specified,
where an attribute is a (name,value) pair, with the value being scalar.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Constructor - generate a new writer instance.

    $writer = Graph::Writer::XML->new();

This doesn't take any arguments.

=head2 write_graph()

Write a specific graph to a named file:

    $writer->write_graph($graph, $file);

The C<$file> argument can either be a filename,
or a filehandle for a previously opened file.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

Attribute values must be scalar. If they're not, well,
you're on your own.
