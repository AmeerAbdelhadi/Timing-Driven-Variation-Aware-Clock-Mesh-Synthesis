=head1 NAME

Graph::Reader - base class for Graph file format readers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Graph::Reader::MyFormat;
    use Graph::Reader;
    use vars qw(@ISA);
    @ISA = qw(Graph::Reader);
    
    sub _read_graph
    {
        my ($self, $graph, $FILE) = @_;
        
        # read $FILE and populate $graph
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Graph::Reader> is a base class for Graph file format readers.
A particular subclass of Graph::Reader will handle a specific
file format, and generate a Graph, represented using Jarkko Hietaniemi's
Graph class.

You should never create an instance of this class yourself,
it is only meant for subclassing. If you try to create an instance
of Graph::Reader, the constructor will throw an exception.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Constructor - generate a new reader instance. This
is a virtual method, or whatever the correct lingo is.
You're not meant to call this on the base class,
it is inherited by the subclasses. Ie if you do something like:

    $reader = Graph::Reader->new();

It will throw an exception.

=head2 read_graph()

Read a graph from the specified file:

    $graph = $reader->read_graph($file);

The C<$file> argument can either be a filename,
or a filehandle for a previously opened file.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

To create your own graph format reader, create a module
which subclasses B<Graph::Reader>. For example, suppose
DGF is a directed graph format - create a B<Graph::Reader::DGF> module,
with the following structure:

    package Graph::Reader::DGF;
    
    use Graph::Reader;
    use vars qw(@ISA);
    @ISA = qw(Graph::Reader);

    sub _read_graph
    {
        my $self  = shift;
        my $graph = shift;
        my $FILE  = shift;
        
        while (<$FILE>)
        {
	}
        
        return 1;
    }
    
    1;

Note the leading underscore on the B<_read_graph()> method.
The base class provides the public method, and invokes the
private method which you're expected to provide, as above.

If you want to perform additional initialisation at
construction time, you can provide an B<_init()> method,
which will be invoked by the base class's constructor.
You should invoke the superclass's initialiser as well,
as follows:

    sub _init
    {
        my $self = shift;
    
        $self->SUPER::_init();
        
        # your initialisation here
    }

Someone can then use your class as follows:

    use Graph::Reader::DGF;
    
    $reader = Graph::Reader::DGF->new();
    $graph = $reader->read_graph('foo.dgf');
