=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an interface to layout and image generation of directed
and undirected graphs in a variety of formats (PostScript, PNG, etc.) using the
"dot", "neato", "twopi", "circo" and "fdp"  programs from the GraphViz project
(http://www.graphviz.org/ or http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/).

=head2 What is a graph?

A (undirected) graph is a collection of nodes linked together with
edges.

A directed graph is the same as a graph, but the edges have a
direction.

=head2 What is GraphViz?

This module is an interface to the GraphViz toolset
(http://www.graphviz.org/). The GraphViz tools provide automatic graph
layout and drawing. This module simplifies the creation of graphs and
hides some of the complexity of the GraphViz module.

Laying out graphs in an aesthetically-pleasing way is a hard problem -
there may be multiple ways to lay out the same graph, each with their
own quirks. GraphViz luckily takes part of this hard problem and does
a pretty good job in a couple of seconds for most graphs.

=head2 Why should I use this module?

Observation aids comprehension. That is a fancy way of expressing
that popular faux-Chinese proverb: "a picture is worth a thousand
words".

Text is not always the best way to represent anything and everything
to do with a computer programs. Pictures and images are easier to
assimilate than text. The ability to show a particular thing
graphically can aid a great deal in comprehending what that thing
really represents.

Diagrams are computationally efficient, because information can be
indexed by location; they group related information in the same
area. They also allow relations to be expressed between elements
without labeling the elements.

A friend of mine used this to his advantage when trying to remember
important dates in computer history. Instead of sitting down and
trying to remember everything, he printed over a hundred posters (each
with a date and event) and plastered these throughout his house. His
spatial memory is still so good that asked last week (more than a year
since the experiment) when Lisp was invented, he replied that it was
upstairs, around the corner from the toilet, so must have been around
1958.

Spreadsheets are also a wonderfully simple graphical representation of
computational models.

=head2 Applications

Bundled with this module are several modules to help graph data
structures (GraphViz::Data::Dumper), XML (GraphViz::XML), and
Parse::RecDescent, Parse::Yapp, and yacc grammars
(GraphViz::Parse::RecDescent, GraphViz::Parse::Yapp, and
GraphViz::Parse::Yacc).

Note that Marcel Grunauer has released some modules on CPAN to graph
various other structures. See GraphViz::DBI and GraphViz::ISA for
example.

brian d foy has written an article about Devel::GraphVizProf for
Dr. Dobb's Journal:
http://www.ddj.com/columns/perl/2001/0104pl002/0104pl002.htm

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This is the constructor. It accepts several attributes.

  my $g = GraphViz->new();
  my $g = GraphViz->new(directed => 0);
  my $g = GraphViz->new(layout => 'neato', ratio => 'compress');
  my $g = GraphViz->new(rankdir  => 1);
  my $g = GraphViz->new(width => 8.5, height => 11);
  my $g = GraphViz->new(width => 30, height => 20,
			pagewidth => 8.5, pageheight => 11);

The most two important attributes are 'layout' and 'directed'.

=over

=item layout

The 'layout' attribute determines which layout algorithm GraphViz.pm will
use. Possible values are: 

=over

=item dot

The default GraphViz layout for directed graph layouts

=item neato

For undirected graph layouts - spring model

=item twopi

For undirected graph layouts - radial

=item circo

For undirected graph layouts - circular

=item fdp

For undirected graph layouts - force directed spring model

=back

=item directed

The 'directed' attribute, which defaults to 1 (true) specifies
directed (edges have arrows) graphs. Setting this to zero produces
undirected graphs (edges do not have arrows).

=item rankdir

Another attribute 'rankdir' controls the direction the nodes are linked
together. If true it will do left->right linking rather than the
default up-down linking.

=item width, height

The 'width' and 'height' attributes control the size of the bounding
box of the drawing in inches. This is more useful for PostScript
output as for raster graphic (such as PNG) the pixel dimensions
can not be set, although there are generally 96 pixels per inch.

=item pagewidth, pageheight

The 'pagewidth' and 'pageheight' attributes set the PostScript
pagination size in inches. That is, if the image is larger than the
page then the resulting PostScript image is a sequence of pages that
can be tiled or assembled into a mosaic of the full image. (This only
works for PostScript output).


=item concentrate

The 'concentrate' attribute controls enables an edge merging technique
to reduce clutter in dense layouts of directed graphs. The default is
not to merge edges.

=item random_start

For undirected graphs, the 'random_start' attribute requests an
initial random placement for the graph, which may give a better
result. The default is not random.

=item epsilon

For undirected graphs, the 'epsilon' attribute decides how long the
graph solver tries before finding a graph layout. Lower numbers allow
the solver to fun longer and potentially give a better layout. Larger
values can decrease the running time but with a reduction in layout
quality. The default is 0.1.

=item overlap

The 'overlap' option allows you to set layout behavior for graph nodes
that overlap.  (From GraphViz documentation:)

Determines if and how node overlaps should be removed.


=over

=item true

(the default) overlaps are retained. 

=item scale

overlaps are removed by uniformly scaling in x and y. 

=item false 

If the value converts to "false", node overlaps are removed by a Voronoi-based technique.

=item scalexy

x and y are separately scaled to remove overlaps.

=item orthoxy, orthxy

If the value is "orthoxy" or "orthoyx", overlaps are moved by optimizing two
constraint problems, one for the x axis and one for the y. The suffix indicates
which axis is processed first.

B<NOTE>: The methods related to "orthoxy" and "orthoyx" are still evolving. The
semantics of these may change, or these methods may disappear altogether. 

=item compress

If the value is "compress", the layout will be scaled down as much as possible
without introducing any overlaps.

=back

Except for the Voronoi method, all of these transforms preserve the orthogonal
ordering of the original layout. That is, if the x coordinates of two nodes are
originally the same, they will remain the same, and if the x coordinate of one
node is originally less than the x coordinate of another, this relation will
still hold in the transformed layout. The similar properties hold for the y
coordinates.

=item no_overlap

The 'no_overlap' overlap option, if set, tells the graph solver to not
overlap the nodes.  Deprecated,  Use 'overlap' => 'false'.

=item ratio

The 'ratio' option sets the aspect ratio (drawing height/drawing width) for the
drawing. Note that this is adjusted before the size attribute constraints are
enforced.  Default value is C<fill>.

=over

=item numeric

If ratio is numeric, it is taken as the desired aspect ratio. Then, if the
actual aspect ratio is less than the desired ratio, the drawing height is
scaled up to achieve the desired ratio; if the actual ratio is greater than
that desired ratio, the drawing width is scaled up.

=item fill

If ratio = C<fill> and the size attribute is set, node positions are scaled,
separately in both x and y, so that the final drawing exactly fills the
specified size.

=item compress

If ratio = C<compress> and the size attribute is set, dot attempts to compress
the initial layout to fit in the given size. This achieves a tighter packing of
nodes but reduces the balance and symmetry. This feature only works in dot.

=item expand

If ratio = C<expand> the size attribute is set, and both the width and the
height of the graph are less than the value in size, node positions are scaled
uniformly until at least one dimension fits size exactly. Note that this is
distinct from using size as the desired size, as here the drawing is expanded
before edges are generated and all node and text sizes remain unchanged.

=item auto

If ratio = C<auto> the page attribute is set and the graph cannot be drawn on a
single page, then size is set to an ``ideal'' value. In particular, the size in
a given dimension will be the smallest integral multiple of the page size in
that dimension which is at least half the current size. The two dimensions are
then scaled independently to the new size. This feature only works in dot. 

=back

=item bgcolor

The 'bgcolor' option sets the background colour. A colour value may be
"h,s,v" (hue, saturation, brightness) floating point numbers between 0
and 1, or an X11 color name such as 'white', 'black', 'red', 'green',
'blue', 'yellow', 'magenta', 'cyan', or 'burlywood'.

=item name

The 'name' option sets name of the graph. This option is useful in few
situations, like client side image map generation, see cmapx.
By default 'test' is used.

=item node,edge,graph

The 'node', 'edge' and 'graph' attributes allow you to specify global
node, edge and graph attributes (in addition to those controlled by
the special attributes described above). The value should be a hash
reference containing the corresponding key-value pairs. For example,
to make all nodes box-shaped (unless explicity given another shape):

  my $g = GraphViz->new(node => {shape => 'box'});

=back

=cut


sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $config = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;
  my $self = {};

  # Cope with the old hashref format
  if (ref($config) ne 'HASH') {
    my %config;
    %config = ($config, @_) if @_;
    $config = \%config;
  }

  $self->{NODES} = {};
  $self->{NODELIST} = [];
  $self->{EDGES} = [];

  if (exists $config->{directed}) {
      $self->{DIRECTED} = $config->{directed};
  } else {
      $self->{DIRECTED} = 1; # default to directed
  }

  if (exists $config->{layout}) {
      $self->{LAYOUT} = $config->{layout};
  } else {
      $self->{LAYOUT} = "dot"; # default layout
  }

  if (exists $config->{name}) {
      $self->{NAME} = $config->{name};
  } else {
      $self->{NAME} = 'test';
  }

  if (exists $config->{bgcolor}) {
      $self->{BGCOLOR} = $config->{bgcolor};
  }

  $self->{RANK_DIR} = $config->{rankdir} if (exists $config->{rankdir});

  $self->{WIDTH} = $config->{width} if (exists $config->{width});
  $self->{HEIGHT} = $config->{height} if (exists $config->{height});

  $self->{PAGEWIDTH} = $config->{pagewidth} if (exists $config->{pagewidth});
  $self->{PAGEHEIGHT} = $config->{pageheight} if (exists $config->{pageheight});

  $self->{CONCENTRATE} = $config->{concentrate} if (exists $config->{concentrate});

  $self->{RANDOM_START} = $config->{random_start} if (exists $config->{random_start});

  $self->{EPSILON} = $config->{epsilon} if (exists $config->{epsilon});

  $self->{SORT} = $config->{sort} if (exists $config->{sort});

  $self->{OVERLAP} = $config->{overlap} if (exists $config->{overlap});
  # no_overlap overrides overlap setting.
  $self->{OVERLAP} = 'false' if (exists $config->{no_overlap});

  $self->{RATIO} = $config->{ratio} || 'fill';

  # Global node, edge and graph attributes
  $self->{NODE_ATTRS} = $config->{node} if (exists $config->{node});
  $self->{EDGE_ATTRS} = $config->{edge} if (exists $config->{edge});
  $self->{GRAPH_ATTRS} = $config->{graph} if (exists $config->{graph});

  bless($self, $class);
  return $self;
}


=head2 add_node

A graph consists of at least one node. All nodes have a name attached
which uniquely represents that node.

The add_node method creates a new node and optionally assigns it
attributes.

The simplest form is used when no attributes are required, in which
the string represents the name of the node:

  $g->add_node('Paris');

Various attributes are possible: "label" provides a label for the node
(the label defaults to the name if none is specified). The label can
contain embedded newlines with '\n', as well as '\c', '\l', '\r' for
center, left, and right justified lines:

  $g->add_node('Paris', label => 'City of\nlurve');

Attributes need not all be specified in the one line: successive
declarations of the same node have a cumulative effect, in that any
later attributes are just added to the existing ones. For example, the
following two lines are equivalent to the one above:

  $g->add_node('Paris');
  $g->add_node('Paris', label => 'City of\nlurve');

Note that multiple attributes can be specified. Other attributes
include:

=over 4

=item height, width

sets the minimum height or width

=item shape

sets the node shape. This can be one of: 'record', 'plaintext',
'ellipse', 'circle', 'egg', 'triangle', 'box', 'diamond', 'trapezium',
'parallelogram', 'house', 'hexagon', 'octagon'

=item fontsize

sets the label size in points

=item fontname

sets the label font family name

=item color

sets the outline colour, and the default fill colour if the 'style' is
'filled' and 'fillcolor' is not specified

A colour value may be "h,s,v" (hue, saturation, brightness) floating
point numbers between 0 and 1, or an X11 color name such as 'white',
'black', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'magenta', 'cyan', or
'burlywood'

=item fillcolor

sets the fill colour when the style is 'filled'. If not specified, the
'fillcolor' when the 'style' is 'filled' defaults to be the same as
the outline color

=item style

sets the style of the node. Can be one of: 'filled', 'solid',
'dashed', 'dotted', 'bold', 'invis'

=item URL

sets the url for the node in image map and PostScript files. The
string '\N' value will be replaced by the node name. In PostScript
files, URL information is embedded in such a way that Acrobat
Distiller creates PDF files with active hyperlinks

=back

If you wish to add an anonymous node, that is a node for which you do
not wish to generate a name, you may use the following form, where the
GraphViz module generates a name and returns it for you. You may then
use this name later on to refer to this node:

  my $nodename = $g->add_node('label' => 'Roman city');

Nodes can be clustered together with the "cluster" attribute, which is
drawn by having a labelled rectangle around all the nodes in a
cluster. An empty string means not clustered.

  $g->add_node('London', cluster => 'Europe');
  $g->add_node('Amsterdam', cluster => 'Europe');

Clusters can also take a hashref so that you can set attributes:

  my $eurocluster = {
    name      =>'Europe',
    style     =>'filled',
    fillcolor =>'lightgray',
    fontname  =>'arial',
    fontsize  =>'12',
  };
  $g->add_node('London', cluster => $eurocluster, @default_attrs);


Nodes can be located in the same rank (that is, at the same level in
the graph) with the "rank" attribute. Nodes with the same rank value
are ranked together.

  $g->add_node('Paris', rank => 'top');
  $g->add_node('Boston', rank => 'top');

Also, nodes can consist of multiple parts (known as ports). This is
implemented by passing an array reference as the label, and the parts
are displayed as a label. GraphViz has a much more complete port
system, this is just a simple interface to it. See the 'from_port' and
'to_port' attributes of add_edge:

  $g->add_node('London', label => ['Heathrow', 'Gatwick']);

=cut

sub add_node {
  my $self = shift;
  my $node = shift;

  # Cope with the new simple notation
  if (ref($node) ne 'HASH') {
    my $name = $node;
    my %node;
    if (@_ % 2 == 1) {
      # No name passed
      %node = ($name, @_);
    } else {
      # Name passed
      %node = (@_, name => $name);
    }
    $node = \%node;
  }

  $self->add_node_munge($node) if $self->can('add_node_munge');

  # The _code attribute is our internal name for the node
  $node->{_code} = $self->_quote_name($node->{name});

  if (not exists $node->{name}) {
    $node->{name} = $node->{_code};
  }

  if (not exists $node->{label})  {
    if (exists $self->{NODES}->{$node->{name}} and defined $self->{NODES}->{$node->{name}}->{label}) {
      # keep our old label if we already exist
      $node->{label} = $self->{NODES}->{$node->{name}}->{label};
    } else {
      $node->{label} = $node->{name};
    }
  } else {
    $node->{label} =~ s#([|<>\[\]{}"])#\\$1#g unless $node->{shape} &&
      ($node->{shape} eq 'record' || ($node->{label} =~ /^<</ && $node->{shape} eq
				      'plaintext'));
  }

  delete $node->{cluster}
    if exists $node->{cluster} && !length $node->{cluster} ;

  $node->{_label} =  $node->{label};

  # Deal with ports
  if (ref($node->{label}) eq 'ARRAY') {
    $node->{shape} = 'record'; # force a record
    my $nports = 0;
    $node->{label} = join '|', map
      { $_ =~ s#([|<>\[\]{}"])#\\$1#g; '<port' . $nports++ . '>' . $_ }
      (@{$node->{label}});
  }

  # Save ourselves
  if (!exists($self->{NODES}->{$node->{name}})) {
    $self->{NODES}->{$node->{name}} = $node;
  } else {
    # If the node already exists, add or overwrite attributes.
    foreach (keys %$node) {
      $self->{NODES}->{$node->{name}}->{$_} = $node->{$_};
    }
  }

  $self->{CODES}->{$node->{_code}} = $node->{name};

  # Add the node to the nodelist, which contains the names of
  # all the nodes in the order that they were inserted (but only
  # if it's not already there)
  push @{$self->{NODELIST}}, $node->{name} unless
    grep { $_ eq $node->{name} } @{$self->{NODELIST}};

  return $node->{name};
}


=head2 add_edge

Edges are directed (or undirected) links between nodes. This method
creates a new edge between two nodes and optionally assigns it
attributes.

The simplest form is when now attributes are required, in which case
the nodes from and to which the edge should be are specified. This
works well visually in the program code:

  $g->add_edge('London' => 'Paris');

Attributes such as 'label' can also be used. This specifies a label
for the edge.  The label can contain embedded newlines with '\n', as
well as '\c', '\l', '\r' for center, left, and right justified lines.

  $g->add_edge('London' => 'New York', label => 'Far');

Note that multiple attributes can be specified. Other attributes
include:

=over 4

=item minlen

sets an integer factor that applies to the edge length (ranks for
normal edges, or minimum node separation for flat edges)

=item weight

sets the integer cost of the edge. Values greater than 1 tend to
shorten the edge. Weight 0 flat edges are ignored for ordering
nodes

=item fontsize

sets the label type size in points

=item fontname

sets the label font family name

=item fontcolor

sets the label text colour

=item color

sets the line colour for the edge

A colour value may be "h,s,v" (hue, saturation, brightness) floating
point numbers between 0 and 1, or an X11 color name such as 'white',
'black', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'magenta', 'cyan', or
'burlywood'

=item style

sets the style of the node. Can be one of: 'filled', 'solid',
'dashed', 'dotted', 'bold', 'invis'


=item dir

sets the arrow direction. Can be one of: 'forward', 'back', 'both',  'none'

=item tailclip, headclip

when set to false disables endpoint shape clipping

=item arrowhead, arrowtail

sets the type for the arrow head or tail. Can be one of: 'none',
'normal', 'inv', 'dot', 'odot', 'invdot', 'invodot.'

=item arrowsize

sets the arrow size: (norm_length=10,norm_width=5,
inv_length=6,inv_width=7,dot_radius=2)

=item headlabel, taillabel

sets the text for port labels. Note that labelfontcolor,
labelfontname, labelfontsize are also allowed

=item labeldistance, port_label_distance

sets the distance from the edge / port to the label. Also labelangle

=item decorateP

if set, draws a line from the edge to the label

=item samehead, sametail

if set aim edges having the same value to the same port, using the
average landing point

=item constraint

if set to false causes an edge to be ignored for rank assignment

=back

Additionally, adding edges between ports of a node is done via the
'from_port' and 'to_port' parameters, which currently takes in the
offset of the port (ie 0, 1, 2...).

  $g->add_edge('London' => 'Paris', from_port => 0);

=cut

sub add_edge {
  my $self = shift;
  my $edge = shift;

  # Also cope with simple $from => $to
  if (ref($edge) ne 'HASH') {
    my $from = $edge;
    my %edge = (from => $from, to => shift, @_);
    $edge = \%edge;
  }

  $self->add_edge_munge($edge) if $self->can('add_edge_munge');

  if (not exists $edge->{from} or not exists $edge->{to}) {
    carp("GraphViz add_edge: 'from' or 'to' parameter missing!");
    return;
  }

  my $from = $edge->{from};
  my $to = $edge->{to};
  $self->add_node($from) unless exists $self->{NODES}->{$from};
  $self->add_node($to) unless exists $self->{NODES}->{$to};

  push @{$self->{EDGES}}, $edge; # should remove!
}


=head2 as_canon, as_text, as_gif etc. methods

There are a number of methods which generate input for dot / neato /
twopi / circo / fdp or output the graph in a variety of formats.

Note that if you pass a filename, the data is written to that
filename. If you pass a filehandle, the data will be streamed to the
filehandle. If you pass a scalar reference, then the data will be
stored in that scalar. If you pass it a code reference, then it is
called with the data (note that the coderef may be called multiple
times if the image is large). Otherwise, the data is returned:

B<Win32 Note:> you will probably want to binmode any filehandles you write
the output to if you want your application to be portable to Win32.

  my $png_image = $g->as_png;
  # or
  $g->as_png("pretty.png"); # save image
  # or
  $g->as_png(\*STDOUT); # stream image to a filehandle
  # or
  #g->as_png(\$text); # save data in a scalar
  # or
  $g->as_png(sub { $png_image .= shift });

=over 4

=item as_debug

The as_debug method returns the dot file which we pass to GraphViz. It
does not lay out the graph. This is mostly useful for debugging.

  print $g->as_debug;

=item as_canon

The as_canon method returns the canonical dot / neato / twopi / circo / fdp  file
which corresponds to the graph. It does not layout the graph - every
other as_* method does.

  print $g->as_canon;


  # prints out something like:
  digraph test {
      node [	label = "\N" ];
      London [label=London];
      Paris [label="City of\nlurve"];
      New_York [label="New York"];
      London -> Paris;
      London -> New_York [label=Far];
      Paris -> London;
  }

=item as_text

The as_text method returns text which is a layed-out dot / neato /
twopi / circo / fdp format file.

  print $g->as_text;

  # prints out something like:
  digraph test {
      node [	label = "\N" ];
      graph [bb= "0,0,162,134"];
      London [label=London, pos="33,116", width="0.89", height="0.50"];
      Paris [label="City of\nlurve", pos="33,23", width="0.92", height="0.62"];
      New_York [label="New York", pos="123,23", width="1.08", height="0.50"];
      London -> Paris [pos="e,27,45 28,98 26,86 26,70 27,55"];
      London -> New_York [label=Far, pos="e,107,40 49,100 63,85 84,63 101,46", lp="99,72"];
      Paris -> London [pos="s,38,98 39,92 40,78 40,60 39,45"];
  }

=head1 NOTES

Older versions of GraphViz used a slightly different syntax for node
and edge adding (with hash references). The new format is slightly
clearer, although for the moment we support both. Use the new, clear
syntax, please.
