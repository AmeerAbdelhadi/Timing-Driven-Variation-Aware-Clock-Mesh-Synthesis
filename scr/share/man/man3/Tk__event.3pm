.IX Title "event 3"
.TH event 3 "2007-11-17" "perl v5.8.5" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
Tk::event \- Miscellaneous event facilities: define virtual events and generate events
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fI$widget\fR\->\fBevent\fR\fIAction\fR(?\fIarg, arg, ...\fR?);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBevent\fR\fIAction\fR methods provides several facilities for dealing with
window system events, such as defining virtual events and synthesizing
events.  Virtual events are shared by all widgets of the same
\&\fBMainWindow\fR.  Different MainWindows can have different
virtual event.
.PP
The following methods are currently supported:
.IP "\fI$widget\fR\->\fBeventAdd\fR(\fB'<<\fR\fIvirtual\fR\fB>>'\fR\fI, sequence \fR?,\fIsequence, ...\fR?)" 4
.IX Item "$widget->eventAdd('<<virtual>>', sequence ?,sequence, ...?)"
Associates the virtual event \fIvirtual\fR with the physical
event sequence(s) given by the \fIsequence\fR arguments, so that
the virtual event will trigger whenever any one of the \fIsequence\fRs
occurs.
\&\fIVirtual\fR may be any string value and \fIsequence\fR may have
any of the values allowed for the \fIsequence\fR argument to the
bind method.
If \fIvirtual\fR is already defined, the new physical event sequences
add to the existing sequences for the event.
.IP "\fI$widget\fR\->\fBeventDelete\fR(\fB'<<\fR\fIvirtual\fR\fB>>'\fR ?,\fIsequence,\fR \fIsequence, ...\fR?)" 4
.IX Item "$widget->eventDelete('<<virtual>>' ?,sequence, sequence, ...?)"
Deletes each of the \fIsequence\fRs from those associated with
the virtual event given by \fIvirtual\fR.
\&\fIVirtual\fR may be any string value and \fIsequence\fR may have
any of the values allowed for the \fIsequence\fR argument to the
bind method.
Any \fIsequence\fRs not currently associated with \fIvirtual\fR
are ignored.
If no \fIsequence\fR argument is provided, all physical event sequences
are removed for \fIvirtual\fR, so that the virtual event will not
trigger anymore.
.IP "\fI$widget\fR\->\fBeventGenerate\fR(\fIevent\fR ?,\fIoption => value, option => value, ...\fR?)" 4
.IX Item "$widget->eventGenerate(event ?,option => value, option => value, ...?)"
Generates a window event and arranges for it to be processed just as if
it had come from the window system.
\&\fI$window\fR is a reference to the window for which the event
will be generated.
\&\fIEvent\fR provides a basic description of
the event, such as \fB<Shift\-Button\-2>\fR or \fB<<Paste>>\fR.
If \fIWindow\fR is empty the whole screen is meant, and coordinates
are relative to the screen.
\&\fIEvent\fR may have any of the forms allowed for the \fIsequence\fR
argument of the bind method except that it must consist
of a single event pattern, not a sequence.
\&\fIOption-value\fR pairs may be used to specify additional
attributes of the event, such as the x and y mouse position;
see \*(L"\s-1EVENT\s0 \s-1FIELDS\s0\*(R" below.  If the \fB\-when\fR option is not specified, the
event is processed immediately:  all of the handlers for the event
will complete before the \fBeventGenerate\fR method returns.
If the \fB\-when\fR option is specified then it determines when the
event is processed.
.IP "\fI$widget\fR\->\fBeventInfo\fR(?'\fB<<\fR\fIvirtual\fR\fB>>'\fR?)" 4
.IX Item "$widget->eventInfo(?'<<virtual>>'?)"
Returns information about virtual events.
If the \fB<<\fR\fIvirtual\fR\fB>>\fR argument is omitted, the return value
is a list of all the virtual events that are currently defined.
If \fB<<\fR\fIvirtual\fR\fB>>\fR is specified then the return value is
a list whose elements are the physical event sequences currently
defined for the given virtual event;  if the virtual event is
not defined then \fBundef\fR is returned.
.SH "EVENT FIELDS"
.IX Header "EVENT FIELDS"
The following options are supported for the \fBeventGenerate\fR
method.  These correspond to the ``%'' expansions
allowed in binding callback for the bind method.
.IP "\fB\-above\fR => \fIwindow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-above => window"
\&\fIWindow\fR specifies the \fIabove\fR field for the event,
either as a window path name or as an integer window id.
Valid for \fBConfigure\fR events.
Corresponds to the %a substitution for binding scripts.
.IP "\fB\-borderwidth\fR => \fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-borderwidth => size"
\&\fISize\fR must be a screen distance;  it specifies the
\&\fIborder_width\fR field for the event.
Valid for \fBConfigure\fR events.
Corresponds to the %B substitution for binding scripts.
.IP "\fB\-button\fR => \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-button => number"
\&\fINumber\fR must be an integer;  it specifies the \fIdetail\fR field
for a \fBButtonPress\fR or \fBButtonRelease\fR event, overriding
any button  number provided in the base \fIevent\fR argument.

.IX Item "-delta => number"
\&\fBnumber\fR must be an integer; it specifies the \fBdelta\fR field for the

multiples of 120.  For example, 120 should scroll the text widget up 4
lines and \-240 would scroll the text widget down 8 lines.  Of course,
other widgets may define different behaviors for mouse wheel motion.
This field corresponds to the \f(CW%D\fR substitution for binding scripts.

.SH "VIRTUAL EVENT EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "VIRTUAL EVENT EXAMPLES"
In order for a virtual event binding to trigger, two things must
happen.  First, the virtual event must be defined with the
\&\fBeventAdd\fR method.  Second, a binding must be created for
the virtual event with the \fBbind\fR method.
Consider the following virtual event definitions:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& $widget->eventAdd('<<Paste>>' => '<Control-y>');
\& $widget->eventAdd('<<Paste>>' => '<Button-2>');
\& $widget->eventAdd('<<Save>>' => '<Control-X><Control-S>');
\& $widget->eventAdd('<<Save>>' => '<Shift-F12>');
.Ve
.PP
In the \fBbind\fR method, a virtual event can be bound like any other
builtin event type as follows:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $entry->bind('Tk::Entry', '<<Paste>>' => sub {
\&                $entry->Insert($entry->selectionGet) });
.Ve
.PP
The double angle brackets are used to specify that a virtual event is being
bound.  If the user types Control-y or presses button 2, or if
a \fB<<Paste>>\fR virtual event is synthesized with \fBeventGenerate\fR,
then the \fB<<Paste>>\fR binding will be invoked.
.PP
If a virtual binding has the exact same sequence as a separate
physical binding, then the physical binding will take precedence.
Consider the following example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& $mw->eventAdd('<<Paste>>' => '<Control-y>','<Meta-Control-y>');
\& $mw->bind('Tk::Entry', '<Control-y>' => sub{print 'Control-y'});
\& $mw->bind('Tk::Entry', '<<Paste>>'   => sub{print 'Paste'});
.Ve
.PP
When the user types Control-y the \fB<Control-y>\fR binding
will be invoked, because a physical event is considered
more specific than a virtual event, all other things being equal.
However, when the user types Meta-Control-y the
\&\fB<<Paste>>\fR binding will be invoked, because the
\&\fBMeta\fR modifier in the physical pattern associated with the
virtual binding is more specific than the \fB<Control-y\fR> sequence for
the physical event.
.PP
Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the virtual event exists.
Indeed, the virtual event never actually needs to be defined, for instance,
on platforms where the specific virtual event would meaningless or
ungeneratable.
.PP
When a definition of a virtual event changes at run time, all windows
will respond immediately to the new definition.
Starting from the preceding example, if the following code is executed:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $entry->bind(ref($entry), '<Control-y>' => undef);
\& $entry->eventAdd('<<Paste>>' => '<Key-F6>');
.Ve
.PP
the behavior will change such in two ways.  First, the shadowed
\&\fB<<Paste>>\fR binding will emerge.
Typing Control-y will no longer invoke the \fB<Control-y>\fR binding,
but instead invoke the virtual event \fB<<Paste>>\fR.  Second,
pressing the F6 key will now also invoke the \fB<<Paste>>\fR binding.
